    <h1>Hello Uncle CJ, nice find there and an even better album.  Keeping with the theme of music here is the next clue:</h1>

    <p>In the song “Gimme Shelter” by the Rolling Stones, the term “It’s just a shot away” is said a number of times.  Count this number, and then subtract 8.  This is the first number to one of the locks. </p>

    <p>In the song “Before They Make Me Run” by the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards says the word “run” a number of times.  Take this number, multiply it by four, and that is the second number on the same lock.</p>

    <p>In the song “Jumpin’ Jack Flash” by the Rolling Stones, the term “jumpin’ jack flash” is said a number of times, this amount is the third number on the same lock.</p>

    <p>Happy listening and good luck!</p>
